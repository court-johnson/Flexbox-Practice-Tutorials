# Flexbox-Practice-Tutorials

---

Flexbox is a handy tool used for layout and placement that I found necessary to learn for front-end development. I studied the [CSS-Trick's guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) 
and began tuturials found online to practice flexbox in multiple layouts.
